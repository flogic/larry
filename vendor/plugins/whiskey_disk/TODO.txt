 - common post-deploy tasks (including db:migrate, server bounce)
   - some sort of simple API for hooks to check which files have changed (either via git rev differences or rsync output), so then the rake task would just do something like:
   
   require 'whiskey_disk/rake'
   
   namespace :deploy do
     task :post_deploy do 
       if changed_in?('db/migrate') or changed?('config/database.yml')
         Rake::Task['db:migrate'].invoke
       end
       # etc. ...
     end
   end
   
 - install hooks (look at maybe git-deploy for good examples)
 - make sure the config repo stuff is optional
