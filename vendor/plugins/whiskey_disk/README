Whiskey Disk -- embarrassingly fast deployments.

  A very opinionated deployment tool, designed to be as fast as technologically
  possible.

  Should work with any project which is git hosted, not just Ruby / Ruby on Rails projects.
  Allows for local deploys as well as remote.

  Dependencies:  rake, ssh, git, rsync on the deployment target server (affectionately
                 referred to as the "g-node" by vinbarnes), bash-ish shell on deployment
                 server.

  Assumptions:

    - you have a Rakefile in the top directory of your project's checkout
    - you are deploying over ssh
    - your project is managed via git
    - you have a second git repository for per-application/per-environment configuration files
    - you are comfortable defining post-setup and post-deployment actions with rake

  Installation:

    As a gem:

    % gem install whiskey_disk

    As a rails plugin:

    % script/plugin install git://github.com/flogic/whiskey_disk.git

  Configuration:

    - look in the examples/ directory for sample configuration files
    - main configuration is in <app_root>/config/deploy.yml
    - per-environment configurations can be stored in <app_root>/config/deploy-<environment>.yml
    - config files are YAML, with a section for each environment.

      Known config file settings (if you're familiar with capistrano and vlad these
      should seem eerily familiar)::
 
      - domain:            host on which to deploy (this is an ssh connect string) 
      - deploy_to:         path to which to deploy main application
      - repository:        git repo path for main application
      - branch:            git branch to deploy from main application git repo
      - deploy_config_to:  where to deploy the configuration repository
      - config_repository: git repository for configuration files
      - project:           project name (used to compute path in configuration checkout)
      - rake_env:          hash of environment variables to set when running post_setup and post_deploy rake tasks

    - defining a deploy:<environment>:post_setup rake task (e.g., in lib/tasks/ or in 
      your project's Rakefile) will cause that task to be run at the end of deploy:setup

    - defining a deploy:<environment>:post_deploy rake task (e.g., in lib/tasks/ or in 
      your project's Rakefile) will cause that task to be run at the end of deploy:now

  Running:

  - rake deploy:setup to=<environment>   (e.g., "staging", "production", etc.)
  - rake deploy:now   to=<environment>
