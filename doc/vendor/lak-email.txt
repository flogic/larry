I think you're really going to like this.

I've attached two files:

pp2yaml, which reads in your datasources init.pp file and produces a data/ directory.  You have to run this from the root of the repository (i.e., it looks for $PWD/modules/datasources/manifests/init.pp), but it wouldn't be hard to fix this.

load_data.rb, which is a function that reads in these data files.  You'll need to modify it to point to your data directory.  There should probably be a way to not hard-code it, but for this, it's good enough.  The function accepts zero or one argument; if an argument is specified, then it loads the data for the that class, and if no argument is specified, then it loads the data for the current class.  Here's the key:  It loads the parameters in that file as local variables in the current class.

So, here's the usage:

1) Make the data dir by running pp2yaml
2) Remove the 'include datasources::*' from your test class
3) Completely unqualify all datasources variables in your test class
4) Add a call to 'load_data' at the *top* of your test class

This will load the newly-created data file's attributes as local variables.

Here's my test manifest:

class wiki {
   load_data()
   notice $clearspace_vhost
}

class testing {
   load_data(gsa)
   notice $gsa_host
}

include wiki, testing

And here's the output:

notice: Scope(Class[wiki]): docspace.corp.redhat.com
notice: Scope(Class[testing]): search.util.phx.redhat.com

Really, other than the issues below I think this does *exactly* what you want, including converting all of the existing data (although, admittedly, not converting all of the existing classes), and it's both more maintainable and more awesome.

Let me know what you think, and whether you'd like to pursue it.  In the meantime, I think I'm going to post it to the list.

Issues:

* Currently throws one warning: Got mismatched variables on line 656: rh_urls_env vs distribution_short.  Meaning that that line doesn't follow the convention.  Should be easy enough to either work around or not put in the data dir.

* Doesn't currently check to see if the value is already set.  This one's nearly trivial to fix.

* Doesn't handle variable interpolation within strings.  Should be easy to fix.
