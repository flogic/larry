 -> I think the puppet-classifer "class"/"service" modeling did a disservice to what I'm trying to do.  Need to unwind this.

 -> there should be a services method for hosts, so that we can easily see what services are supposed to be on the host.  The deployments are, in a sense, the detailed "Actually deployed on the host" services.  So, in a sense, the services are being linked via destinations to deployments on hosts (if the destination is a same-host destination then destination is almost a no-op way to get from service to deployment, which belongs_to host)

 -> app.rb:  hosts does a double-method call (demeter!).  Have instance.rb declare :host and delegate to that instead
 
 -> destination.rb:  is this defunct?
 
 -> instance links to services via a requirements many:many model.  Should there be a graph closure from instance (and maybe vice-versa) so that we get the full set?  Maybe this should just be driven from the view.
 
 -> looks like services controller doesn't have specs for the alternate formats being delivered
 
 -> start adding forms for maintaining data
 
 -> more views
